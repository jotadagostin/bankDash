Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript — consistency with your other projects
Tailwind CSS v4 — you already know it
Recharts — for 3 graphs (bar, pie, area). Simpler than Visx, more beautiful "out of the box" than pure Tremor
nuqs — period filters synchronized in the URL (ex: ?period=week)
Zustand — light global status (e.g. balance selected, card active)
Zod — form validation (Quick Transfer)
Suspense + skeleton — loading state on cards and graphics
Data mocked in structured JSON (not hardcoded in the component) — simulates a real API and makes it easier to exchange for fetch later

Build order (the one I would follow)

Phase 1 — Foundation

Project setup + Tailwind v4 with @theme (design colors: royal blue, purple, cyan, orange)
Base layout: fixed sidebar + content area with header (search, icons, avatar)
Overview page responsive grid (set breakpoints before any component)

Phase 2 — Static components (no dynamic data yet) 4. Sidebar with active state 5. Header (search bar, icons, avatar) 6. Cards "My Cards" (gradient + fixed mocked data) 7. Recent Transaction (simple list)

Phase 3 — Graphics 8. Weekly Activity (slash, Recharts) with mock data 9. Expense Statistics (donut, Recharts) with calculated captions 10. Balance History (area, Recharts) with mock data

Phase 4 — Real interactivity 11. Quick Transfer: avatar carousel + controlled input + Zod validation 12. Period filter (nuqs) connected to Weekly Activity and Balance History together 13. Skeleton loading with Suspense (simulate fetch delay)

Phase 5 — Polishing 14. Mobile responsiveness (sidebar becomes drawer/bottom nav) 15. Empty/error states (even if mocked, it shows maturity) 16. Second page (Transactions) with table + pagination, if it takes time

└── index.ts → tipos TypeScript (Transaction, Card, etc.) (CardData.variant("primary" | "secondary") allows you to visually differentiate the blue card from the white card without duplicating the type.
Transaction.type("income" | "expense") is used to decide whether the value appears green or red, and for the plus/minus sign.
Transaction.icon is a union of fixed strings (not loose strings) — this forces you to only use icons that you will actually map in the component, avoiding silent typing errors.
ExpenseCategory.color stores the pre-defined color (referencing the variables in globals.css), so the chart component doesn't need to have hardcoded "which color for which category" logic.)
